# STMArkanoid

## Overview
This project combines arkanoid with micro-controller STM32f4 discovery.
This means that we are able to control our 'pipe' with accelerometer builded in micro-controller. How cool is this! :)
But, if you don't have in your garage exacly the same or none of micro-controller models- don't worry!
You can easily compile,run and play with keyboard arrows.

### Arkanoid
Arkanoid game is the most known( and old) game, after Pong, but not all of you may recognize it by the name.
So check this [Arkanoid Screenshot]: http://bit.ly/ArkanoidScreenshot
We've chosen this game, because it is simple and gives a lot of fun. 

### STM32f4
I suggest refering to [Wiki]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STM32#STM32_F4
